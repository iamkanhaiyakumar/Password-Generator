A password generator is a tool or program that creates random and secure passwords for various purposes, such as user accounts or online services. It ensures passwords are unique, unpredictable, and resistant to hacking attempts by incorporating randomness, customizable length, diverse character sets (including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special symbols), and adherence to security standards. Users can customize parameters like length and character types, enabling them to generate strong passwords tailored to their security needs.
